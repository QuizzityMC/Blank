### Recommended Design: "Nutball" or "Versa Wing" Style
These proven designs are:
- Simple to build
- Durable (foam construction)
- Easy to repair
- Stable in flight

## Detailed Build Instructions

### Phase 1: Planning & Templates (Day 1)

1. **Download Free Plans**
   - Search for "Nutball RC plane plans" or "simple foam RC plane"
   - Print templates at 100% scale
   - Alternatively, create simple rectangular wing and fuselage

2. **Create Templates**
   - Wing: Rectangle 800mm x 200mm
   - Fuselage: 500mm long, 100mm wide
   - Tail surfaces: 200mm x 100mm (horizontal), 150mm x 100mm (vertical)

### Phase 2: Cutting & Assembly (Day 1-2)

#### Wing Construction
1. Cut wing from foam board (800mm x 200mm)
2. Score center line on one side (don't cut through)
3. Add 3-degree dihedral by folding and reinforcing with tape
4. Reinforce leading edge with popsicle sticks
5. Add wing spar (popsicle stick) at 30% chord

#### Fuselage Construction
1. Cut fuselage base (500mm x 80mm)
2. Build motor mount from foam board layers
3. Create battery compartment with removable hatch
4. Reinforce with popsicle sticks where servos mount
5. Build simple box fuselage or use foam board folded into triangular shape

#### Tail Surfaces
1. Cut horizontal stabilizer (200mm x 80mm)
2. Cut vertical stabilizer (150mm x 100mm)
3. Cut elevator control surface (200mm x 30mm)
4. Cut rudder control surface (150mm x 40mm)
5. Create hinges using clear tape or toothpicks

### Phase 3: Electronics Installation (Day 2-3)

#### Motor Installation
1. Mount motor on firewall (front or rear depending on config)
2. Ensure propeller has 5mm clearance
3. Test motor direction (should pull/push air correctly)
4. Secure with hot glue

#### Servo Installation
1. Mount elevator servo in fuselage
2. Mount rudder servo in fuselage or vertical stabilizer
3. Create control linkages from paper clips or wire
4. Ensure servos move freely, 30-40 degrees throw

#### Receiver & Battery
1. Mount receiver in fuselage (wrap in foam for crash protection)
2. Create secure battery compartment
3. Ensure battery is easily removable
4. Balance plane with battery position (CG at 30% chord)

#### Wiring
1. Connect motor to speed control or directly to receiver
2. Connect servos to receiver channels:
   - Channel 1: Rudder
   - Channel 2: Elevator
3. Test all controls before final assembly
4. Secure all wires with tape or hot glue

### Phase 4: Final Assembly & Adjustment (Day 3)

1. **Attach Wing to Fuselage**
   - Use rubber bands for removable wing
   - Or hot glue for permanent (not recommended for beginners)

2. **Attach Tail Surfaces**
   - Glue horizontal stabilizer to fuselage
   - Ensure it's level and straight
   - Glue vertical stabilizer on top

3. **Balance Check (Critical!)**
   - Hang plane from wing at 30% chord point
   - Nose should drop slightly or be level
   - Adjust battery position to achieve correct CG
   - Mark final battery position

4. **Control Surface Check**
   - Rudder right = plane turns right
   - Elevator up = nose goes up
   - Adjust servo reversing if needed

5. **Finish**
   - Add decorative tape or markers
   - Seal all foam edges with tape
   - Add name/contact info

## Pre-Flight Checklist

### Before Every Flight
- [ ] Check battery charge (must be full)
- [ ] Verify all control surfaces move correctly
- [ ] Check propeller is secure and undamaged
- [ ] Ensure CG is correct
- [ ] Test transmitter range (walk 30m away)
- [ ] Check for loose parts or damage
- [ ] Verify motor runs smoothly

### First Flight Preparation
- [ ] Choose large, open field (football field size minimum)
- [ ] Calm weather (wind less than 10 km/h)
- [ ] No obstacles or people nearby
- [ ] Have helper for launch
- [ ] Fully charged battery
- [ ] Transmitter batteries fresh

## Flight Instructions

### Hand Launch Technique
1. Hold plane gently but firmly at balance point
2. Face into wind
3. Apply 50% throttle
4. Throw gently forward and slightly upward
5. Let plane fly away from you
6. Gradually increase throttle if needed

### First Flight
1. Launch plane gently
2. Let it fly straight and level
3. Make small control inputs
4. Keep altitude moderate (3-5 meters)
5. Land after 30 seconds (save battery)
6. Check for any issues

### Landing
1. Reduce throttle to 0%
2. Aim for grass area
3. Keep nose slightly up
4. Glide to ground
5. Foam construction is very forgiving!

## Safety Considerations

### General Safety
- **Never fly near people, animals, or property**
- **Always fly in open areas away from roads**
- **Keep plane in visual line of sight**
- **Don't fly in rain or strong wind**
- **Propeller can cause injury - keep fingers away when powered**
- **LiPo batteries can be dangerous if damaged**

### Battery Safety
- Never overcharge LiPo batteries
- Don't discharge below 3.0V per cell
- Store at 3.7-3.8V per cell
- Keep away from flammable materials
- Dispose of damaged batteries properly

### Legal Considerations
- Check local RC flying regulations
- Some areas require permits or club membership
- Stay below 120m altitude (Australia CASA rules)
- Don't fly within 5.5km of airports
- Respect private property

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Plane Won't Fly Straight
- Check CG (should be at 30% chord)
- Ensure wing is not warped
- Verify tail surfaces are straight
- Check for wind pushing plane

### Plane Dives
- CG too far forward (move battery back)
- Elevator trim needs adjustment
- Elevator reversed - check servo direction

### Plane Climbs and Stalls
- CG too far back (move battery forward)
- Too much up elevator
- Flying too slow

### Motor Weak or Not Running
- Check battery charge
- Verify all connections
- Check propeller not damaged
- Motor may be underpowered for weight

### Poor Control Response
- Increase control surface throw
- Check linkages are secure
- Verify servos have enough power
- Check for binding in controls

## Upgrades & Improvements (Future)

Once basic plane works:
1. Add ailerons for better control ($3-5 for extra servo)
2. Upgrade to brushless motor system ($15-20)
3. Add LED lights for visibility ($2)
4. Build storage/transport box
5. Create multiple paint schemes
6. Try different designs (flying wing, biplane)

## Tips for Success

### Building Tips
- Take your time - rushing leads to mistakes
- Use sharp knife for clean foam cuts
- Hot glue cools quickly - work fast
- Less glue is better (adds weight)
- Test fit before gluing permanently
- Keep plane lightweight!

### Flying Tips
- Practice on a simulator first (free options available)
- Fly in the morning (calmer air)
- Start with short flights
- Learn to repair crashes
- Join a local RC club for advice
- Take spare batteries
- Bring repair supplies to field (tape, glue)

### Cost Saving Tips
- Salvage motors from old toys
- Use old phone batteries (if safe)
- Buy components in bulk with friends
- Check secondhand electronics stores
- 3D print parts if you have access
- Join RC forums for deals and advice

## Conclusion

Building an RC plane for under $30 AUD is challenging but achievable with:
- Careful planning and budgeting
- Simple, proven designs
- Salvaged or budget components
- Patience and willingness to learn

The key is starting simple. Your first plane probably won't be perfect, but you'll learn valuable skills. Foam is cheap and easy to repair, so crashes are learning opportunities.

**Most Important**: Have fun and fly safely!
